# Emerging Technologies Submission 2022/2023
**Declan Kelly** - **G00378925**<br>

This repository contains my assessment submission for my university module [Emerging Technologies](https://www.gmit.ie/emerging-technologies) [1].<br>
In this module you are encouraged to explore the state of the art in programming languages, messaging protocols and the future of computing.

All material that will be assessed will be stored inside Jupyter notebooks, normally you would have to download to run these,<br>
but I have an instance of JupyterLab running on GitHub pages that run inside your browser without having to install anything.

JupyterLite instance: [https://g00378925.github.io/emerging-technologies](https://g00378925.github.io/emerging-technologies)

The topics I will be covering will be the following:

1. GitHub actions
2. JupyterLite
3. Computation
    1. Growth rates/Big O notation
    2. Turing machine
4. Fourier Transform
5. Quantum Computing

## JupyterLite instance

An instance of JupyterLite [2] is hosted on GitHub pages,
when a commit is pushed to the repostitory [this GitHub action](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) is executed,
building and deploying a version of JupyterLite that can run in the browser,
I explain this more in-depth in my `01-github-pages.ipynb` and `02-jupyterlite.ipynb` notebooks.
