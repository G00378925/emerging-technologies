What is a server?\n\nA server can refer to the physical computer that runs the server program, which is typically more powerful than a personal computer with more CPU cores and RAM memory. In the context of software applications, a server is an instance of running software that continuously listens for incoming requests. When it receives a request, it performs the necessary computations and returns a response to the requestor.\n\nWhen you access a website in your web browser, your browser sends a **request** to a remote computer called a server. The server responds with the desired information, which is known as a **response**. This communication is made possible by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)[[2]](#http), which is built on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).",

This can include files stored on the file system that are delivered to users through a web server software like Apache or Nginx.\n\nIn the past, browsers relied more on backend logic and less on client-side code. However, the rise of JavaScript has allowed for more code execution to be done in the browser, reducing the need for heavy backend processing.\n\nUsing the client's browser to execute code can be more efficient than using server-side resources. However, backends are still necessary for tasks such as retrieving data from a remote database.",

This is known as continuous integration and continuous delivery, and it allows developers to quickly verify that their code is working as intended. In GitHub, actions are defined in a YAML file located at `.github/workflows`.\n\n\nOne advantage of using GitHub Actions over the legacy method of using separate branches (such as gh-pages) is that it allows you to generate documentation directly from the repository. This is in line with the principles of Git, which was originally designed for version control of the Linux kernel and assumes that branches contain different versions of the same codebase. Having two branches with completely different content goes against the principles of Git.\n\nIt's important to note that GitHub Actions is a GitHub-only feature and is not available on other platforms like GitLab or Bitbucket.",

For example, the Docker containerization platform uses YAML files (such as `docker-compose.yml`) to store configuration information.
