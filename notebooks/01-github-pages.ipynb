    "## 1. What is a Server?\n",
    "It's debatable what a server is; it can refer to the physical computer that runs the server software; these are typically more powerful than personal computers, featuring more CPU cores and more RAM memory. When you are referring to the software, a server is a program that is continuously listening for incoming requests; when it receives a request, it does the computations requested and returns the response to the computer that requested it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you request a website in a web browser, the browser sends a **request** to a computer elsewhere; this computer is called a server. The server will then send back the information you requested; this is known as a **response**. This is all made possible using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)."

    "## 2. Static vs Dynamic Content\n",
    "Static content doesn't change, this can include files stored on a file system that are delivered to users through a web server solution such as Apache or Nginx. Examples of static files would be images, JavaScript, and CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, browsers relied more on backend logic and less on client-side code due to personal computers being less powerful. The rise of JavaScript has allowed for more code execution to be done in the browser, reducing the need for heavy backend processing. Even though the content looks dynamic, the content being sent to the web browser is static JavaScript code; the dynamicity is done on the browser side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the client's browser to execute code can be more efficient than using server-side resources. Backends are still necessary for tasks such as retrieving data from a remote database. PHP allows you to return dynamically generated web pages without the need for JavaScript to pull in this data. This is considered dynamic content because dynamicity is done on the server side."

    "### Representational state transfer\n",
    "The Representational state transfer (REST) is a way of architecting APIs, so the only context that API needs to know in order to fufill the request is inside the request message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an API is described as RESTful, it is somewhat compliant with the REST architecture. Static websites commonly retrieve data from other internet resources through the use of a RESTful API with the use of the `fetch` function in JavaScript. RESTful APIs can be used by a wide variety of programming languages, all they need is the ability to perform HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a non-RESTful API would be one that uses cookies in order to maintain its state; this is a form of a session token, and you are required to have this in every request so the API can keep track of the transactions between the client and the server. This is non-RESTful because all the context the API needs to fulfill is not in the request."
